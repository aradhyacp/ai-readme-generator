Reviewing large pull requests can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This bot acts as a first line of defense by: - Analyzing the **git diff** to understand context. - Providing actionable feedback on code quality. - Detecting security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks. - Saving time for maintainers by handling routine checks. Built with **Node.js** and powered by **GitHub Actions**, it integrates seamlessly into any repository's workflow. --- ## ✨ Features - [x] **Automated Diff Analysis**: Uses a custom `diff_extractor.js` to parse PR changes precisely. - [x] **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverages Large Language Models to provide human-like feedback. - [x] **Line-by-Line Comments**: Can provide context-aware suggestions directly on the affected lines. - [x] **Seamless Integration**: Triggered automatically on `pull_request` events. - [x] **Customizable**: Configure the AI's behavior via workflow environment variables. - [x] **Developer Friendly**: Easy to set up with minimal configuration. --- ## 🛠 Tech Stack ### 💻 Languages & Core | Technology | Purpose | | :--- | :--- | | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" width="25" height="25" /> **JavaScript** | Core logic and scripting | | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg" width="25" height="25" /> **Node.js** | Runtime environment | | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/github/github-original.svg" width="25" height="25" /> **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD Automation & Workflow | ### 📦 Dependencies - **@actions/github**: For GitHub API interaction. - **@actions/core**: To handle GitHub Action inputs and outputs. - **OpenAI / AI Provider SDK**: To interface with the LLM. --- ## 📸 Demo & Screenshots > *Add your own screenshots here to showcase the bot in action!* ### Bot Comment Example ![AI PR Review Bot Comment Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=AI+Bot+Commenting+on+a+PR+Diff) ### Workflow Execution ![GitHub Actions Workflow Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=GitHub+Actions+Workflow+Running) --- ## 📂 Project Structure ```bash ai-pr-review-bot/ ├── .github/ │ └── workflows/ │ └── ai-review.yml # GitHub Action workflow definition ├── diff_extractor.js # Logic to extract and format code diffs ├── index.js # Main entry point: Connects GitHub API with AI ├── package.json # Project metadata and dependencies ├── package-lock.json # Locked dependency tree └── README.md # Project documentation ``` - **`index.js`**: Orchestrates the review process—listening to triggers and calling the AI. - **`diff_extractor.js`**: A specialized utility to parse the `git diff` format into a prompt-friendly structure. - **`.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`**: The configuration file that enables the bot in your repository. --- ## 🚀 Getting Started To use this bot in your repository: 1. **Clone the Repository**: ```bash git clone https://github.com/aradhyacp/ai-pr-review-bot.git ``` 2. **Install Dependencies**: ```bash npm install ``` 3. **Setup Secrets**: In your GitHub repository settings, add the following secrets: - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your AI provider API key. - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub, but ensure the workflow has permission to write comments. 4. **Enable Workflow**: Ensure `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` is present in your main branch. --- ## ⚙️ Configuration The `ai-review.yml` file defines how the bot triggers. You can modify it to suit your needs: ```yaml on: pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize] jobs: review: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Run AI Review env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} run: node index.js ``` --- ## 🤝 Contributing Contributions are welcome!
